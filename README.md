# Kaedim MCP Agent

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** implementation for intelligent 3D asset request processing. This system automates the complete lifecycle of 3D asset creation requests—from initial validation through artist assignment to final delivery—using an event-driven, tool-based architecture that mirrors real-world production pipelines.

## 🎯 What This System Does

Imagine you run a 3D asset creation studio that receives hundreds of requests daily. Each request needs to be:

1. **Validated** against customer-specific technical requirements
2. **Planned** with the right workflow steps based on business rules
3. **Assigned** to the best available artist with matching skills
4. **Tracked** with complete audit trails for quality assurance

This MCP system automates that entire process, making intelligent decisions while providing clear explanations and graceful error handling.

## 🛠 MCP Tools: The Heart of the System

Each tool represents a critical decision point in the 3D asset production pipeline. Here's the intuitive logic behind each one:

### 🔍 **`validate_preset(request_id, account_id)`**

**"Can we technically deliver what the customer wants?"**

**The Problem**: Every customer has unique technical requirements—different naming conventions, texture packing formats, and quality standards. Processing a request with invalid configurations would waste days of artist time and result in unusable assets.

**The Logic**:

- **Naming Validation**: Checks if the customer's file naming pattern is properly configured (e.g., "AXR*{asset}*{lod}")
- **Texture Packing Validation**: Ensures all 4 RGBA channels are mapped (Red=AO, Green=Metallic, Blue=Roughness, Alpha=Emissive)
- **Version Compatibility**: Verifies the preset version is specified and supported

**Real-World Example**:

- ✅ ArcadiaXR has complete config → "Validation passed (v3)"
- ❌ TitanMfg missing alpha channel → "Missing texture channels: a"
- ❌ BlueNova has no config → "No texture packing configuration found"

**Returns**: `{ok: boolean, errors: string[], preset_version: number}`

---

### 📋 **`plan_steps(request_id)`**

**"What's the optimal workflow to create this asset?"**

**The Problem**: Different asset types require different production steps. A stylized character needs different workflows than a realistic vehicle. Business rules determine special requirements (priority queue, specific export formats, quality checks).

**The Logic**:

- **Base Workflow**: Starts with standard steps: `initial_review → modeling → texturing → qa_check → delivery`
- **Rule Matching**: Scans business rules to add specialized steps:
  - Account "ArcadiaXR" + style "stylized_hard_surface" → Add `style_tweak_review`
  - Engine "Unreal" → Add `export_unreal_glb`
  - Topology "quad_only" → Add `validate_topology_quad_only`
  - Priority "priority" → Enable expedite queue (24hr SLA)
- **Time Estimation**: Calculates hours based on complexity and special requirements

**Real-World Example**:

```
req-001 (ArcadiaXR, Unreal, stylized) →
["initial_review", "modeling", "texturing", "style_tweak_review", "export_unreal_glb", "qa_check", "delivery"]
Estimated: 14 hours
```

**Returns**: `{steps: string[], matched_rules: RuleMatch[], estimated_hours: number, priority_queue: boolean}`

---

### 👩‍🎨 **`assign_artist(request_id)`**

**"Who's the best artist to handle this request right now?"**

**The Problem**: Artists have different skills, availability, and capacity limits. Assigning the wrong artist leads to delays, quality issues, or burnout. The system needs to balance skill matching with workload distribution.

**The Matching Algorithm**:

1. **Skill Scoring**: Each artist gets points for matching required skills:

   - Engine match (Unity/Unreal): +5 points
   - Style match (stylized/realistic/lowpoly): +5 points
   - Topology match (quad_only): +5 points
   - Priority handling: +2 points

2. **Capacity Filtering**: Only considers artists with available slots:

   - `active_load < capacity_concurrent`
   - Example: Ben has capacity=1, active_load=0 → ✅ Available
   - Example: Ada has capacity=2, active_load=2 → ❌ At capacity

3. **Best Match Selection**: Picks highest scoring available artist

**Real-World Example**:

```
req-002 (TitanMfg, Unreal, quad_only, priority) →
Ben: +5(Unreal) +5(quad_only) +2(priority) = 12/20 → SELECTED
Cleo: +2(other skills) = 2/20 → Alternative
```

**Returns**: `{artist_id: string, artist_name: string, match_score: number, reason: string, alternative_artists: Artist[]}`

---

### 📝 **`record_decision(request_id, decision)`**

**"How do we maintain complete audit trails for quality and compliance?"**

**The Problem**: Production environments require full traceability. When a customer asks "Why was my request delayed?" or "Who worked on this asset?", you need complete records of every decision made.

**The Logic**:

- **Unique Decision ID**: Generates UUID for each decision
- **Complete Context**: Stores the full decision object with all tool results
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains chronological trace of all tool calls
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks processing times and success rates
- **Event Emission**: Broadcasts decision events for monitoring systems

**What Gets Recorded**:

```json
{
  "decision_id": "uuid-1234",
  "request_id": "req-001",
  "status": "success",
  "rationale": "Human-readable explanation",
  "validation_result": {...},
  "plan": {...},
  "assignment": {...},
  "trace": [
    {"step": "validate_preset", "timestamp": "...", "result": {...}},
    {"step": "plan_steps", "timestamp": "...", "result": {...}},
    {"step": "assign_artist", "timestamp": "...", "result": {...}}
  ],
  "metrics": {"processing_time_ms": 15, "agent_type": "mcp_client"}
}
```

**Returns**: `{decision_id: string, status: string}` + Event emission

## 📊 MCP Resources: The Knowledge Base

Resources provide read-only access to the system's knowledge base. Think of them as the "memory" the tools consult when making decisions.

### 🗂️ **`resource://requests`** - The Active Queue

**Contains**: All incoming 3D asset requests waiting to be processed
**Structure**: Array of request objects with metadata like account, style, engine, priority
**Used By**: All tools need to understand what they're processing

### 👥 **`resource://artists`** - The Talent Roster

**Contains**: Artist profiles with skills, capacity limits, and current workload
**Structure**: Array of artist objects with skills arrays and capacity tracking
**Used By**: `assign_artist` tool for intelligent matching and load balancing

### ⚙️ **`resource://presets`** - Customer Configurations

**Contains**: Account-specific technical requirements and validation rules
**Structure**: Map of account names to preset configurations
**Used By**: `validate_preset` tool to ensure technical compliance

### 📋 **`resource://rules`** - Business Logic Rules

**Contains**: Conditional workflow rules that determine special processing steps
**Structure**: Array of if-then rules with conditions and actions
**Used By**: `plan_steps` tool to build customized workflows

---

## 🔄 The Complete Processing Flow

Here's how a request moves through the system, with real examples:

### **Step 1: Request Intake**

```json
// New request arrives
{
  "id": "req-001",
  "account": "ArcadiaXR",
  "style": "stylized_hard_surface",
  "engine": "Unreal",
  "priority": "standard"
}
```

### **Step 2: Validation Check**

```
🔍 validate_preset("req-001", "ArcadiaXR")
├── ✅ Found preset configuration (version 3)
├── ✅ Naming pattern configured: "AXR_{asset}_{lod}"
├── ✅ Complete RGBA texture packing
└── Result: {ok: true, preset_version: 3}
```

### **Step 3: Workflow Planning**

```
📋 plan_steps("req-001")
├── Base workflow: [initial_review, modeling, texturing, qa_check, delivery]
├── Rule match: ArcadiaXR + stylized → Add [style_tweak_review]
├── Rule match: Unreal engine → Add [export_unreal_glb]
└── Result: 7 steps, 14 estimated hours, standard priority
```

### **Step 4: Artist Assignment**

```
👩‍🎨 assign_artist("req-001")
├── Scoring artists for: style=stylized, engine=Unreal
├── Ben: +5 (Unreal) = 7/20, has 1 slot available ✅
├── Cleo: +2 (other skills) = 2/20, has 1 slot available
└── Result: Assigned to Ben (best match with availability)
```

### **Step 5: Decision Recording**

```
📝 record_decision("req-001", {complete_decision_object})
├── Generated decision ID: "mcp-req-001-1758521644"
├── Status: "success"
├── Audit trail: All 3 tool calls with timestamps
└── Result: Decision persisted, events emitted
```

### **Final Output**

```json
{
  "request_id": "req-001",
  "status": "success",
  "rationale": "Request req-001 from ArcadiaXR processed successfully. Validation passed (v3), 7 workflow steps planned, assigned to Ben with score 7/20.",
  "assignment": {
    "artist_id": "a-2",
    "artist_name": "Ben",
    "match_score": 7
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Error Handling: When Things Go Wrong

The system gracefully handles validation failures with customer-safe messaging:

### **Validation Failure Example: Missing Texture Channels**

```json
// req-002 (TitanMfg) has incomplete preset
{
  "request_id": "req-002",
  "status": "validation_failed",
  "rationale": "Request req-002 failed validation: Missing texture channels: a. Customer preset must be fixed before processing.",
  "customer_message": "Configuration issue for TitanMfg: Your texture packing is incomplete. Please configure all RGBA channels for proper rendering.",
  "clarifying_question": "Should we use default channel mappings or wait for your configuration?",
  "validation_result": {
    "ok": false,
    "errors": ["Missing texture channels: a"],
    "preset_version": 1
  }
}
```

**Why This Happens**: TitanMfg's preset only defines RGB channels (`"r": "ao", "g": "metallic", "b": "roughness"`) but is missing the alpha channel mapping.

### **Validation Failure Example: No Configuration Found**

```json
// req-003 (BlueNova) has no preset at all
{
  "request_id": "req-003",
  "status": "validation_failed",
  "rationale": "Request req-003 failed validation: No texture packing configuration found, Preset version not specified. Customer preset must be fixed before processing.",
  "customer_message": "Validation error: No texture packing configuration found",
  "clarifying_question": "Would you like help updating your preset?"
}
```

**Why This Happens**: BlueNova account doesn't exist in the presets.json file at all.

### **Capacity Overflow: The Current Limitation**

**What happens when ALL artists are at capacity?**

Let's trace through a real scenario:

```bash
# Test scenario: All artists at full capacity
📊 Artist Status:
  Ada: 2/2 slots used - ❌ AT CAPACITY
  Ben: 1/1 slots used - ❌ AT CAPACITY
  Cleo: 1/1 slots used - ❌ AT CAPACITY

🔍 New request arrives: stylized_hard_surface, Unreal engine
```

**Current System Behavior**:

1. **assign_artist tool runs** → Scores all artists but sets score = 0 for anyone at capacity
2. **No artists have score > 0** → Returns `{artist_id: None, reason: "No available artists"}`
3. **Client sees `artist_id = None`** → Marks status as `"assignment_failed"`
4. **Customer gets message**: _"Your request is queued and will be assigned soon."_
5. **Reality**: There's NO actual queue - it's just a polite lie! 😅

**The Problems**:

- ❌ Request marked as "failed" when it should be "queued"
- ❌ No actual queuing mechanism - request sits in limbo
- ❌ No estimated wait time for customer
- ❌ No notification when capacity becomes available
- ❌ No retry mechanism or overflow handling

**Sample Output**:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req-overflow",
  "status": "assignment_failed", // Misleading - not really "failed"
  "customer_message": "Your request is queued and will be assigned soon.", // False, not assigned. Put under future work
  "assignment": {
    "artist_id": null,
    "reason": "No available artists with matching skills"
  }
}
```

> **💡 This limitation is exactly why the Future Work section proposes an intelligent queuing system!**

---

## ⚠️ Current System Limitations

While this MCP implementation demonstrates core concepts effectively, several limitations make it unsuitable for production use without enhancements:

### **🚫 Critical Limitation: No Real Queuing System**

**The Problem**: When all artists reach capacity, the system provides misleading feedback to customers.

**Current Behavior**:

```python
# In _assign_artist() - when all artists are at capacity:
if available_capacity > 0:
    score += available_capacity * 2
else:
    score = 0  # ❌ Zero score = can't assign

# Result when ALL artists have score = 0:
return {
    "artist_id": None,
    "reason": "No available artists with matching skills"
}
```

**Client Response**:

```python
# In process_request() - misleading customer communication:
elif not assignment_result.get("artist_id"):
    status = "assignment_failed"  # ❌ Not really "failed"
    customer_message = "Your request is queued and will be assigned soon."  # ❌ LIE!
    clarifying_question = "Would you like priority processing?"  # ❌ False hope
```

**Real-World Impact**:

- **Customer Experience**: Told they're "queued" when no queue exists
- **Business Operations**: No visibility into actual demand overflow
- **Revenue Loss**: Requests marked as "failed" instead of properly queued
- **Scaling Decisions**: No data on when to hire additional artists

### **📊 Other Current Limitations**

#### **1. Static Capacity Model**

- Artists can't update their availability in real-time
- No support for partial availability or time slots
- No consideration of task complexity affecting capacity

#### **2. Simplistic Skill Matching**

- Basic string matching for skills (no fuzzy matching)
- No skill level/experience weighting
- No learning from past assignment success rates

#### **3. Limited Business Rules**

- Rules engine only supports simple if-then conditions
- No complex multi-condition logic or priorities
- No dynamic rule updates without server restart

#### **4. No Persistence or State Management**

- Server is stateless (decisions lost on restart)
- No integration with external project management systems
- No historical data for analytics or optimization

#### **5. Basic Error Handling**

- Generic error messages for complex validation failures
- No retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Limited customer guidance for resolving issues

## � Agent Intelligence Features

### **Smart Decision Making**

The agent doesn't just execute tools—it makes intelligent decisions based on the results:

- **Stops Early on Validation Failure**: If validation fails, still runs planning/assignment for complete audit trail, but marks status as failed
- **Generates Human-Readable Rationales**: Combines tool results into clear explanations
- **Provides Customer-Safe Error Messages**: Translates technical errors into actionable feedback
- **Suggests Next Steps**: Offers clarifying questions to help resolve issues

### **Complete Audit Trails**

Every decision includes:

- **Trace Array**: Chronological record of all tool calls with timestamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time in milliseconds
- **Tool Results**: Full output from each validation, planning, and assignment step
- **Decision Context**: Request details, matched rules, artist reasoning

---

## 🎛️ Events & Observability

The system emits structured events for monitoring and debugging:

- **`tool.called`** - Tool invocation with arguments and timestamp
- **`tool.completed`** - Execution time and success status
- **`validation.failed`** - Specific validation errors with context
- **`decision.recorded`** - Final decision persistence with unique ID

These events appear in the logs and can be consumed by monitoring systems.

## 🚀 Future Work & Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation but requires several enhancements to become production-ready. Each enhancement directly addresses the limitations identified above:

### **🔄 Intelligent Queuing System**

_Addresses: Critical capacity overflow limitation_

**Current Problem**: When all artists are at capacity, requests are marked as "failed" with false promises of queuing.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement a real queuing system with proper capacity management:

#### **Queue Management Features**

```python
# New tool: queue_request(request_id, queue_priority, estimated_completion)
{
  "status": "queued",
  "queue_position": 3,
  "estimated_start_time": "2025-09-23T14:30:00Z",
  "queue_type": "priority",  # or "standard"
  "alternative_options": [
    {
      "option": "external_contractor",
      "cost_multiplier": 1.5,
      "delivery_time": "2025-09-22T18:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "option": "simplified_workflow",
      "quality_impact": "minor",
      "delivery_time": "2025-09-22T16:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Smart Queue Prioritization**

- **SLA-Based Ordering**: Priority requests jump ahead in queue
- **Skill-Based Queuing**: Separate queues per artist based on specialized skills
- **Dynamic Rebalancing**: Automatically redistributes queue when artists become available
- **Customer Communication**: Real-time updates on queue position and estimated start times

#### **Load Prediction & Optimization**

```python
# Predictive capacity planning
def predict_capacity(time_horizon_hours=48):
    return {
        "current_utilization": 85,  # percentage
        "predicted_availability": [
            {"artist_id": "a-2", "available_at": "2025-09-22T16:00:00Z"},
            {"artist_id": "a-1", "available_at": "2025-09-23T09:00:00Z"}
        ],
        "queue_backlog_hours": 12,
        "recommendation": "Consider hiring temporary contractor for priority queue"
    }
```

#### **Advanced Assignment Strategies**

- **Time-Slicing**: Split large requests across multiple artists
- **Skill Development**: Assign simpler tasks to junior artists with senior oversight
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency gains
- **Cross-Training Recommendations**: Identify skill gaps and training opportunities

### **🤖 LLM-Enhanced Decision Making**

_Addresses: Simplistic skill matching and basic error handling limitations_

**Current Problem**: Basic string matching for skills and generic error messages.

**Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
